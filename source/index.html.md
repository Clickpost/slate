# Introduction

Welcome to the Clickpost API! You can use our API to access Clickpost API endpoints, which can get information on our different APIs:

1. Create Order: Create order on Courier Partner and fetch AWB
2. Track Order: Track your orders
3. Recommendation Engine: Recommend list of Courier Partners in priority order

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, PHP and Python! 

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
